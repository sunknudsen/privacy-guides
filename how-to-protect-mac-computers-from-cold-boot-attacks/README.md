## Guide

### Run following command using “Terminal” app.

```shell
sudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1 hibernatemode 25 standbydelaylow 0 standbydelayhigh 0
```

👍

`destroyfvkeyonstandby 1` tells macOS to destroy password when computer goes to standby mode.

`hibernatemode 25` tells macOS to store the content of the RAM to the hard drive and power off the RAM (which clears its data).

`standbydelaylow 0` tells macOS to enable standby mode immediately when battery is low and computer is put to sleep.

`standbydelayhigh 0` tells macOS to enable standby mode immediately when battery is high and computer is put to sleep.

Run `man pmset` using “Terminal” app for more information.
