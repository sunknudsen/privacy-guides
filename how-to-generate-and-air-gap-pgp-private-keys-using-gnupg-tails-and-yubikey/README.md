# How to generate and air gap PGP private keys using GnuPG, Tails and YubiKey

> Heads-up: guide inspired by https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide.

## Requirements

- [Tails USB flash drive or SD card](../how-to-install-tails-on-usb-flash-drive-or-sd-card-on-macos) with VeraCrypt [installed](../how-to-install-and-use-veracrypt-on-tails)
- YubiKey with [OpenPGP](https://www.yubico.com/us/store/compare/) support (firmware version `5.2.3` or higher)
- Computer running macOS Catalina (should work on Big Sur)

## Caveats

- When copy/pasting commands that start with `$`, strip out `$` as this character is not part of the command
- When copy/pasting commands that start with `cat << "EOF"`, select all lines at once (from `cat << "EOF"` to `EOF` inclusively) as they are part of the same (single) command

## Setup guide (on Tails)

### Step 1: boot to Tails and set admin password

> Heads-up: if keyboard layout of computer isn’t “English (US)”, set “Keyboard Layout”.

Click “+” under ”Additional Settings”, then “Administration Password”, set password, click “Add” and finally “Start Tails”.

### Step 2: establish network connection using ethernet cable or Wi-Fi and wait for Tor to be ready

Connected to Tor successfully

👍

### Step 3: import Dennis Fokin’s PGP public key (used to verify downloads below)

```console
$ gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --search-keys 9E885C0302F9BB9167529C2D5CBA11E6ADC7BCD1
gpg: data source: https://keys.openpgp.org:443
(1)	Dennis Fokin <dennis.fokin@yubico.com>
	  4096 bit RSA key 0x5CBA11E6ADC7BCD1, created: 2019-09-17
Keys 1-1 of 1 for "9E885C0302F9BB9167529C2D5CBA11E6ADC7BCD1".  Enter number(s), N)ext, or Q)uit > 1
gpg: key 0x5CBA11E6ADC7BCD1: public key "Dennis Fokin <dennis.fokin@yubico.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
```

imported: 1

👍

### Step 4: download [YubiKey Manager](https://www.yubico.com/support/download/yubikey-manager/) AppImage release and associated PGP signature

```console
$ torsocks curl -L -o ~/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager-qt/Releases/yubikey-manager-qt-latest-linux.AppImage
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   281  100   281    0     0    200      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:--   200
100 81.9M  100 81.9M    0     0   457k      0  0:03:03  0:03:03 --:--:--  818k

$ torsocks curl -L -o ~/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage.sig https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager-qt/Releases/yubikey-manager-qt-latest-linux.AppImage.sig
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   285  100   285    0     0    215      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:--   215

```

### Step 5: verify “YubiKey Manager” AppImage release (learn how [here](../how-to-verify-pgp-digital-signatures-using-gnupg-on-macos)) and make AppImage executable

```console
$ gpg --verify ~/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage.sig
gpg: assuming signed data in '/home/amnesia/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage'
gpg: Signature made Tue 18 May 2021 07:16:45 AM UTC
gpg:                using RSA key D6919FBF48C484F3CB7B71CD870B88256690D8BC
gpg: Good signature from "Dennis Fokin <dennis.fokin@yubico.com>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 9E88 5C03 02F9 BB91 6752  9C2D 5CBA 11E6 ADC7 BCD1
     Subkey fingerprint: D691 9FBF 48C4 84F3 CB7B  71CD 870B 8825 6690 D8BC

$ chmod +x ~/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage
```

Good signature

👍

### Step 6 (optional): copy “YubiKey Manager” AppImage to “Persistent” folder (requires Tails “Personal Data” persistence feature to be enabled)

```shell
cp ~/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage ~/Persistent/
```

### Step 7: extract and patch “YubiKey Manager” AppImage (required to run bundled [ykman](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016614940-YubiKey-Manager-CLI-ykman-User-Manual), see [issue](https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-manager/issues/436) on GitHub)

> Heads-up: step is not persistent meaning it has to be completed each time one needs to run `ykman` on Tails.

#### Extract “YubiKey Manager” AppImage

> Heads-up: replace `Downloads` by `Persistent` if “YubiKey Manager” AppImage has been copied to “Persistent” folder.

```console
$ cd

$ ~/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage --appimage-extract
```

#### Patch “YubiKey Manager” AppImage

```console
$ sed -i "s/ykman-gui/ykman/" ~/squashfs-root/AppRun

$ sed -i -r "s/#\!.*(python[0-9.]+)$/#\!\/home\/amnesia\/squashfs-root\/usr\/bin\/\1/" ~/squashfs-root/usr/bin/ykman
```

#### Add and source `ykman` Bash alias

```
echo 'alias ykman="/home/amnesia/squashfs-root/AppRun"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 8: generate master key (used to sign signing, encryption and authentication subkeys)

When asked for passphrase, create and memorize strong passphrase or use output from `gpg --gen-random --armor 0 24` (and store password in air-gapped password manager).

```console
$ gpg --expert --full-generate-key

Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: John Doe
Email address: john@example.net
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "John Doe <john@example.net>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

### Step 9: set master key ID environment variable

> Heads-up: replace `0xC2709D13BAB4763C` with master key ID.

```shell
KEY_ID=0xC2709D13BAB4763C
```

### Step 10 (optional): sign master key using another master key

#### Import signing master key (if necessary)

> Heads-up: replace `/path/to/signing/master.asc` with signing master key path.

```console
$ gpg --import /path/to/signing/master.asc
gpg: key 0xDFCECB410CE8A745: public key "John Doe <john@example.net>" imported
gpg: key 0xDFCECB410CE8A745: secret key imported

gpg:               imported: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
```

#### Sign master key

> Heads-up: replace `0xDFCECB410CE8A745` with signing master key ID.

```console
$ gpg --ask-cert-level --default-key 0xDFCECB410CE8A745 --sign-key $KEY_ID

### Step 12: mount backup volume (formatted using exFAT)

Click “Places”, then “Home”, then backup volume (“Samsung BAR” in example below), enter admin password and finally click “Authenticate”.

### Step 13: set backup volume name environment variable

```shell
VOLUME_NAME="Samsung BAR"
```

### Step 14: create VeraCrypt encrypted volume (used to store master key and subkeys)

```console
$ /home/amnesia/Persistent/veracrypt --text --create "/media/amnesia/$VOLUME_NAME/tails"
Volume type:
 1) Normal
 2) Hidden
Select [1]: 1

```

The VeraCrypt volume has been successfully created.

👍

### Step 15: mount VeraCrypt encrypted volume

Click “Applications”, then “Utilities”, then “Unlock VeraCrypt Volumes”, then “Add”, select “tails” file on backup volume, click “Open”, enter password and finally click “Unlock”.

### Step 16: rename VeraCrypt encrypted volume

> Heads-up: replace `tcrypt-1793` with directory found using `ls /dev/mapper` and ignore dirty bit is set error.

```console
$ ls /dev/mapper
control  TailsData_unlocked  tcrypt-1793  tcrypt-1793_1  tcrypt-1793_2

$ sudo fatlabel /dev/mapper/tcrypt-1793 Tails

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for amnesia:
fatlabel: warning - lowercase labels might not work properly with DOS or Windows
0x25: Dirty bit is set. Fs was not properly unmounted and some data may be corrupt.
 Automatically removing dirty bit.
```

### Step 17: set VeraCrypt encrypted volume name environment variable

> Heads-up: replace `3FDC-B4EB` with directory found using `ls /media/amnesia`.

```console
$ ls /media/amnesia
3FDC-B4EB   LaCie  'Samsung BAR'

$ ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_NAME="3FDC-B4EB"
```

### Step 18: export master key, subkeys and public key to VeraCrypt encrypted volume

```console
$ gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $KEY_ID > /media/amnesia/$ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_NAME/master.asc

$ gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys $KEY_ID > /media/amnesia/$ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_NAME/sub.asc

$ gpg --armor --export $KEY_ID > /media/amnesia/$ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_NAME/pub.asc
```

### Step 19: copy public key to backup volume

> Heads-up: replace `johndoe` with name associated to master key.

```shell
cp /media/amnesia/$ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_NAME/pub.asc "/media/amnesia/$VOLUME_NAME/johndoe.asc"
```

### Step 20: dismount VeraCrypt encrypted volume

Click “Applications”, then “Utilities”, then “Unlock VeraCrypt Volumes” and finally click “x”.

### Step 21: back up `tails` file

> Heads-up: files stored in `tails` include private keys which, if lost, results in loosing one’s cryptographic identity (safeguard backup mindfully).

> Heads-up: never unlock `tails` on macOS (or any other computer that isn’t air-gapped and hardened).

### Step 22: insert and provision YubiKey

> Heads-up: default user PIN is `123456` and default admin PIN is `12345678`.

### Step 24: require YubiKey user interaction for signing, encryption and authentication operations

```console
$ ykman openpgp keys set-touch sig on --force
Enter Admin PIN:

$ ykman openpgp keys set-touch enc on --force
Enter Admin PIN:

$ ykman openpgp keys set-touch aut on --force
Enter Admin PIN:
```

### Step 25 (optional): disable all YubiKey interfaces except for OpenPGP over USB

> Heads-up: increase `sleep` delay if “Error: No YubiKey detected!” error is thrown.

```console
$ ykman config usb --enable OPENPGP --force

$ for interface in FIDO2 HSMAUTH OATH OTP PIV U2F; do ykman config usb --disable $interface --force; sleep 3; done

$ ykman config nfc --disable-all --force
```

### Step 26 (optional): enable YubiKey configuration lock

> Heads-up: configuration lock prevents configuring YubiKey without entering lock code (store lock code in air-gapped password manager).

```console
$ ykman config set-lock-code --generate
Using a randomly generated lock code: cce9181f4a97bac00459419986510d40
Lock configuration with this lock code? [y/N]: y
```

### Step 27 (optional): extend expiry date of signing, encryption and authentication subkeys (required once a year)

#### Mount backup volume (formatted using exFAT)

Click “Places”, then “Home”, then backup volume (“Samsung BAR” in example below), enter admin password and finally click “Authenticate”.

#### Mount VeraCrypt encrypted volume

Click “Applications”, then “Utilities”, then “Unlock VeraCrypt Volumes”, then “Add”, select “tails” file on backup volume, click “Open”, enter password and finally click “Unlock”.

#### Import master key

```console
$ gpg --import /media/amnesia/Tails/master.asc
gpg: key 0xC2709D13BAB4763C: 1 signature not checked due to a missing key
gpg: key 0xC2709D13BAB4763C: public key "John Doe <john@example.net>" imported
gpg: key 0xC2709D13BAB4763C: secret key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
```

#### Set master key ID environment variable

```shell
KEY_ID=0xC2709D13BAB4763C
```

#### Extend expiry date of signing, encryption and authentication subkeys

```console
$ gpg --edit-key $KEY_ID

### Step 6: set master key ID environment variable

> Heads-up: replace `0xC2709D13BAB4763C` with master key ID.

```shell
KEY_ID=0xC2709D13BAB4763C
```

### Step 7: configure GnuPG

#### Create or override `dirmngr.conf`

Heads-up: back up current config using `cp ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf.backup` (if necessary).

```shell
cat << "EOF" > ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf
disable-ipv6
keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org
EOF
```

#### Create or override `gpg.conf`

Heads-up: back up current config using `cp ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf.backup` (if necessary).

```shell
cat << EOF > ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
cert-digest-algo SHA512
charset utf-8
default-key $KEY_ID
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 AES256 AES192 AES ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed

require-cross-certification
s2k-cipher-algo AES256
s2k-digest-algo SHA512
throw-keyids
use-agent
verify-options show-uid-validity
with-fingerprint
EOF
```

#### Back up and overwrite `gpg-agent.conf`

Heads-up: back up current config using `cp ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf.backup` (if necessary).

```shell
cat << "EOF" > ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
default-cache-ttl 60
default-cache-ttl-ssh 60
enable-ssh-support
max-cache-ttl 120
max-cache-ttl-ssh 120
pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac
EOF
```

### Step 8: configure shell

> Heads-up: run `echo $SHELL` to find default shell.

#### Bash (`/bin/bash`)

```shell
cat << "EOF" >> ~/.bashrc
export GPG_TTY="$(tty)"
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)
gpgconf --launch gpg-agent
gpg-connect-agent UPDATESTARTUPTTY /bye > /dev/null
EOF
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Z Shell (`/bin/zsh`)

```shell
cat << "EOF" >> ~/.zshrc
export GPG_TTY="$(tty)"
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)
gpgconf --launch gpg-agent
gpg-connect-agent UPDATESTARTUPTTY /bye > /dev/null
EOF
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 9: generate SSH public key

> Heads-up: replace `john@example.net` with email and `johndoe` with name associated to master key.

git config --global gpg.program $(which gpg)
git config --global user.signingkey $KEY_ID
```

### Step 12 (optional): publish public key to hkps://keys.openpgp.org

$ gpg --send-keys $KEY_ID
gpg: sending key 0xC2709D13BAB4763C to hkps://keys.openpgp.org
```

gpg: sending key 0xC2709D13BAB4763C to hkps://keys.openpgp.org
